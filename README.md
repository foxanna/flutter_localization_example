# Flutter localization sample with [i69n](https://pub.dev/packages/i69n)

## Features ✨

* Keeps translations in `.yaml` files, one per each language;
* Generates String getters into `.dart` files for all strings in each `.yaml` file;
* No manual String keys declaration, and no guessing whether such key exists;
* Watches file system changes and regenerates Dart code with standard `build_runner watch` command;
* Supports parameters and pluralization in translations.

All details on this approach are described in [this post](https://medium.com/@anna.domashych/yet-another-localization-approach-in-flutter-477cf058ba41).
